# Decision Record Template

RedTeam superset — durable artifact for `.redteam/reviews/` or project ADR folders. Produced by `/redteam record`.

## When to write

- After GO or GO WITH CONDITIONS from `review`
- End of strategic `sequence` playbook
- Any one-way door decision (`reversibility`)

## Confidence

**Overall:** High / Medium / Low

[1–2 sentences on what would change confidence.]

## Review schedule

**Next review:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Trigger events:** [what forces early revisit]
```

## Decision journal (optional, personal)

Separate file in `.redteam/sessions/` for calibration practice:

```markdown
# Decision Journal — [date]

**Decision:**
**Expected outcome:**
**Confidence (0–100%):**
**Time horizon for feedback:**
**What would prove me wrong:**
**Emotional state (honest):**
```

## ADR integration

If the project uses `docs/engineering/adrs/`, offer to mirror this record there with `docslime add adr` or manual copy — keep `.redteam/reviews/` as the red team source of truth.
