## Groupthink Mitigation (GTM)

### 1-2-4-Whole Group
**ACT/GTM:** GTM | **Time:** 30–60 min | **Group:** 4+

Iterative: individual → pairs → fours → whole group. Everyone's voice enters before groupthink sets in.

1. **One:** Individual reflection, written pre-commitment
2. **Two:** Pairs share and refine
3. **Four:** Pairs combine; identify biases and gaps
4. **Whole:** Full group synthesis

### 1 on 1, 2 on 2, Exchange Emissaries
**ACT/GTM:** GTM | **Time:** 45–90 min | **Group:** 8+

Like 1-2-4 but emissaries carry views between subgroups for greater divergence.

### Circle of Voices

Structured round-robin; each person speaks once before anyone speaks twice.

### Fishbowl
**ACT/GTM:** GTM | **Time:** 30–60 min

Inner circle discusses while outer circle observes; swap roles. Surfaces dynamics.

### Think-Write-Share
**ACT/GTM:** GTM | **Time:** 10–20 min

Silent writing before any discussion. Prevents anchoring on first speaker.

### Troika Consulting
**ACT/GTM:** GTM | **Time:** 20–30 min

Three-person consulting rotation: client presents, consultants discuss while client listens.

### Yes...And
**ACT/GTM:** GTM | **Time:** ongoing

Build on ideas without blocking. Divergent phase only.

### Dot Voting
**ACT/GTM:** GTM | **Time:** 10 min

Each participant allocates dots across options. Quick convergence.

### Gallery Walk
**ACT/GTM:** GTM | **Time:** 20–40 min

Ideas posted; participants silently annotate and build on others' work.
